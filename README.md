# Github Setup instructions

Github is a reposotiory of codes that we can share with team mates, recruiters and the general public as well. There are privacy settings for hiding code as well, but we will not go into that.

# Step 1 - Make a profile

Register with Github using your personal/school Email ID. 

## Downloading software 

Get the Github software from [this link](https://desktop.github.com/)

Remember to choose the MacOS version if you're on a Mac.

## Repositories and codes

All code for a particular project resides in a <i>repository</i>. 
Each repository (<i>repo</i> for short) can contain different kinds of files, from .py, .R, .ipynb, and even images like .jpg or .png

The repo we are reading this file in is called <b>github_setup</b>
Repos have to exist in two places to be useful - in GitHub (which is already made) and in your local desktop/laptop. 

A key function of the repo is to sync the codes in your local laptop and the codes in GitHub.

To get the codes into your local laptop, we <b>clone</b> the <i>repository</i> FROM GitHub TO your laptop. 

The software we installed <i>GitHub Desktop</i> helps us to do that. 

## Cloning this repository

1. Goto File -> Clone Repository
2. In the new window, select (if not selected already) the tab called <i>GitHub.com</i>
3. <i>Filter</i> out this Repo's name - <b>github_setup</b> and select the repo (it should highlight in Blue)
4. Under <i>Local path</i> given underneath, choose a location where you want to save the codes.
5. Click <b>Clone</b>

Once github finishes the process, goto the local path you entered and check that folder. All the files, including this README.MD file should be there.


## Pulling in the latest code after cloning into the repo

In the parent folder where this Github repo was cloned, using the Github desktop app, <b>Pull</b> the latest changes. It will automatically pull in the latest code changes from the repo into your laptop to keep your code updated. Note : This is a manual step.

## Pushing your changes and codes into this repo

There are 3 steps in this process - 
1. Choosing files
2. Commit
3. Push

STEP 1 --> In the Github desktop app, on the left panel, select all the files that you want to backup in the git server. NOTE : Only send codes and documents. <b>Do NOT SEND data files such as .csv, .xlsx etc.</b>

STEP 2 --> At the bottom of the left panel <b>Commit</b> your changes. You WILL have to enter a commit message. Put one line on what changes you made for the rest of the team to understand quickly. (Shortcut - ctrl+ENTER for windows)

STEP 3 --> <b>Push</b> the changes into the Git server. This needs internet connection. The <b>Push</b> button would be on the ribbon. (Shortcut - ctrl+p for windows)
  
 Happy coding!
